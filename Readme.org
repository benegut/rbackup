* A simple backup script

** Installguide
#+begin_src bash
./install
#+end_src
This will place the script and two symlinks in =~/.local/bin/=, and a example configuration file in =~/.config/backup/=.

** Configuration
After installation, you can find the config file =~/.config/backup/backup.conf=, which you should edit.
Each line of the file is one backup strategy, consisting of a name, the directory to backup, the remote host address and the remote directory, where the backup will be put.
Example:
#+begin_quote
doc /home/user/Documents/ user@host backups/
#+end_quote
